## The Idea
It is often said that the first step is always the hardest - and my blog endeavour confirms that. I've created a place to share my thoughts in November 2022 with a plan to post regularly. Deciding on a platform (substack vs. medium vs. own site) and potential blog post ideas were the easy part. But publishing the actual content is the challenging bit. My internal perfectionist says that whatever I create is not yet fit for publishing and I need to spend few more days on another draft.

This post is an experiment that could help me break this vicious cycle. The rules are simple:
- Start small & easy - Listing ideas and areas of my expertise is relatively easier than going deep into a selected topic.
- Accountability - Thanks to listing topics I immediately feel pushed to turn them into actual blog posts. If I share my goals with my audience I have a higher chance to keep my promise.
- It's an experiment - By calling it an experiment I'm not scared of failure. It can either jump-start my blogging habit or become a learning opportunity that will fuel next experiment.

Enough theory, let's move to the essence of this post. I've grouped my ideas into themes that I plan to expand whenever new ideas comes up. I encourage you to leave a comment if you would like me to focus on a particular topic first.

## Growth - How I keep to self-improve
